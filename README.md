 Code written in C# created during the Programming for Business Applications course offered through the University of Central Oklahoma. Permission to post from Dr. Michelle Hepner, the instructor of the course.

# Project 1
Declares two integers and two doubles, then computes and displays their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Project 2
Reads in grades input by the user, then computes and displays their average.

# Project 3
Prompts the user for minimum grades to receive a letter grade, then asks for a student's grade. The program will display the letter grade of the student according to the user's grading levels.

# Project 4
Prompts the user for the salary or hourly wage, then determines their weekly pay.

- If salary, their wage is divided by 52 (the number of weeks in a year) and displayed to the console.

- If hourly, the user is prompted for how many hours they worked that week. Their wage is computed by their hourly wage multiplied by the hours worked. If the hours worked is over 40, overtime is also computed. Their weekly wage is displayed to the console.

# Project 5
Displays a menu to the user for "Rent-A-Wreck." The methods the user can choose from include: adding a car to the inventory, renting a car, returning a car, removing a car, and exiting the menu. 

- When adding a car to the inventory, the user is prompted for make, model, year, mileage, and mpg. The car's isRented value is initialized as false. 

- When renting a car, only unrented cars are displayed and the user is asked to make a selection. If the selection is valid, the car's isRented value is set to true. 

- When returning a car, only rented cars are displayed and the user is asked to make a selection. The user is prompted for the new mileage on the car, and their fee for renting the car is displayed. The isRented value for the car is set to false. 

- When removing a car, only unrented cars are displayed and the user is asked to make a selection. If the selection is valid, the car is deleted from all lists containing its information.
